# GymFriends

This is an app for those that want to see where they stand against their gym friends.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

You can go [here](https://nicomrtnz1.github.io/gymFriends/) to view this app running based on main branch via GitHub Pages. 

## Things to come

Would like to move away from local storage and connect to a database so users can look at their data on different devices.

More charts! Charts with triggers that group large datasets be age or weight. A network graph to show friends that people have in-common.
