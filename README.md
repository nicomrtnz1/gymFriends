# GymFriends

This is an app for those that want to see where they stand against their gym friends. Once past the home page you will be add a friend's name, age, weight, and friends they have. You can add multiple friends. Once you have added all of your friends you can move on the view results and visually see how you compare to your friends.

## Build

## Things that need improvements
- Needs more time improving the overall look and feel of the app to maximize user experience.
- Need to look more into D3 features and best practices to be able to display data in an elegant way and have proper unit testing. For instance, my intention with the friends form field was to take the list of friends and make a networking chart so the user can see how their friends may know each other.
- Need to verify friends are unique to avoid confusion when viewing data.

## Things to come
- Swap out local storage with proper database to allow for multiple device usage.
- Authentication
- More fields to better compare friends. ex: height(for things like bmi), gender, length of gym membership ...
- More charts!
- Info icons that display more information about charts and form fields.
