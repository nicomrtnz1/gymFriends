# GymFriends

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Things to come

Would like to move away from local storage and connect to a database so users can look at their data on different devices.

More charts! Charts with triggers to group large datasets be age or weight. A network graph to show friends that people have in-common.
